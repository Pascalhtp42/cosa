**USDM OSB Uploader**

Setting up clinical trials and managing study designs is often manual, time-consuming, and prone to errors. The USDM OSB Uploader automates this process by seamlessly integrating USDM files with OSB platforms, allowing full study uploads or modular handling of study components.

It includes built-in validation, error handling, and type-safe operations to ensure accuracy and consistency, saving study teams significant time while reducing manual effort.

**sas_dataset_json**

The sas_dataset_json package converts SAS datasets to Dataset-JSON and back, using SAS extended attributes to capture all necessary metadata.
Although it’s built entirely in SAS, it gives users precise, flexible control for creating and reading Dataset-JSON files.

**aNCA**

The aNCA package enables users to perform full Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA) without any coding, automatically generating PP, ADPP, TLGs, and other outputs based on user-defined settings. Designed for pharmacometricians, clinical pharmacologists, preclinical scientists, and regulatory teams.

It supports transparent, standardized, and customizable NCA workflows across organizations. The open-source project is actively maintained through GitHub, includes contributor guidelines, and offers a fully featured suite of NCA tools—from exploratory plots and PK parameters to dose-escalation slide drafts and customizable tables and listings.

**soa_workbench**

The SoA Workbench addresses a gap in clinical study design: the lack of a user-friendly interface to build a Schedule of Activities and generate valid, standard-conformant USDM v4.0 outputs. This Python-based web application allows teams to create, edit, and version SoAs across multiple studies.
<br/><br/>
Users may link activities to CDISC Biomedical Concepts, and run diff reports for impact analysis. Designed for clinical programmers, protocol developers, and medical writers, the tool is actively developed in GitHub, where contributions, issue reporting, and code reviews are fully supported.
