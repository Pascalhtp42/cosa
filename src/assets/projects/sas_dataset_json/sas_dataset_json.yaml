detailedDescription:
  problem: Dataset-JSON (https://www.cdisc.org/dataset-json) is a next-generation
    data transfer format. This package supports v1.1 and later, enabling mutual
    reading and writing between Dataset-JSON or ndjson format and SAS data sets.
  solution: The sas_dataset_json package converts SAS datasets to Dataset-JSON
    files and performs reverse conversions. It uses SAS extended attributes to
    retain and utilize the metadata required for conversion. Although it is 100%
    SAS code, users can flexibly and precisely create and read Dataset-JSON
    files by using extended attributes. One key feature and strength of this
    package is that it leverages SAS extended attributes to generate the
    necessary metadata, eliminating the need for Define.xml. This makes it
    possible to support data transfers even before the creation of a Define
    file.
  openSourceConsiderations: SAS itself is not open source, but it can provide open
    source solutions by sharing the programs it has created. Users should be
    presented with a variety of options, and since R has been gaining popularity
    recently, my motivation was to promote SAS as a alternative.
  maintenanceModel: If you have any questions, please contact me via GitHub
    (https://github.com/Morioka-Yutaka/sas_dataset_json) or email.
  projectSize: Medium
  contributors: Contributions (issues/pull requests) can be made through GitHub,
    and the repository maintainers will determine if the changes are approved or
    declined.
  userDetails: Basic SAS skills and a minimum understanding of the Dataset-JSON
    specification
  preRequisites: This package was developed and tested in a Windows environment
    with SAS 9.4 (TS1M8). It is expected to run properly on SAS 9.4 or later
    regardless of the maintenance release version, and is also assumed to work
    in cloud environments such as Viya; however, it has not been tested there.
    The SAS macros in this package can be executed individually, but they are
    also designed to be installed and loaded through the SAS Packages Framework
    (SPF) [https://github.com/yabwon/SAS_PACKAGES].
  projectServiceOptions: Community support only
  sponsors: NA
  goalsObjectives: One of the motivations and goals of this package is to maximize
    the available options for reading and writing Dataset-JSON. In addition, in
    the PMDA region, namely Japan, adoption of Dataset-JSON tends to lag behind.
    Therefore, another important purpose is to encourage greater participation
    from Japanese users and to promote communication within the community.
  communications: I share release information in the SAS Packages Users &
    Developers group on LinkedIn, publish it on PharmaForest
    (https://github.com/PharmaForest), and also present it at SAS-related events
    in Japan.
  additonalInformation: I would like to express my gratitude to my organization,
    EPS Corporation, for their understanding and support. I am also deeply
    grateful to the members of the Phuse Japan OST Working Group, as their
    activities served as the inspiration for this project.
