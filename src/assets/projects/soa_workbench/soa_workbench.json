  "detailedDescription": {
    "problem": "An easy-to-use utility with user interface does not exist for the creation of a study schedule of activities. This  interface must allow the creation of an encounter matrix with the linking of CDISC Biomedical Concepts with the  activities to support the export of valid, standard-conformant USDM v4.0.",
    "solution": "A simple Python web-based application allows for the creation of SoA for multiple studies, which allows for editing of \na study SoA, version tracking, protocol amendments.  The solution supports associating biomedical concepts in the CDISC \nlibrary with activities defined in the SoA.  Diff reporting is supported for impact analysis. Multiple AI solutions are\nused in the implementation of this project.  copilot is also used in GitHub pull requests and code reviews.",
    "openSourceConsiderations": "This project is concsered fully open-source and is available for cloning, branching, and forking.  This project is in \nits early stages and, by making it open-source, the hope is other developers and volunteers will get involved to help \ncreate a more robust solution that adds additional benefits to the industry.",
    "maintenanceModel": "The project is in development and available for branching, forking and contribution. Issues can be reported in GitHub.\nIssues are fixed via branching and raising Pull Requests which must be assinged to a Reviewer prior to Merge.",
    "projectSize": "260MB currently with the expectation the project will grow as the project matures and features are added.",
    "contributors": "Contributors must use the automated testing configured currently as well as those developed in future\nreleases.",
    "userDetails": "The primary users of SoA Workbench are clinical programmers, protocol developers, medical writers. ",
    "preRequisites": "Python and Git must be installed on a developer system.  Visual Studio Code is recommended as an IDE.",

    "goalsObjectives": "Creation of SoA for study and generation of USDM v4.0 JSON to be used in downstream processes for 360i project.\nRequirements:\n  * UI to design a study with at least the study header info, info for trial design domains, and schedule of activities\n  * Integration with CDISC Library for adding BCs to each activity in the SoA\n  * Generate USDM-JSON 4.0\n  * Amend a protocol and keep versioning \n  * Do an impact analysis (at minimum for this stage, just comparing difference between original protocol and amendment(s))\n  * Simple SoA visualization (or at least csv/xlsx export) to review SoA.\n  * Import existing protocols (can possibly use one of the open-source solutions from the AI Challenge; bonus add, not MVP)",
