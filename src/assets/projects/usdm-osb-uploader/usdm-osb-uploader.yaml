detailedDescription:
  problem: >-
    Clinical trial setup and study design management traditionally involves extensive
    manual data entry and configuration across multiple systems. The process of
    uploading USDM (Unified Study Data Model) files to OSB (Open Study Builder)
    platforms requires hours of manual work, is prone to human error, and lacks
    standardization. Study teams often struggle with inconsistent data mapping,
    validation errors, and time-consuming manual processes that delay study initiation.
    There is a critical need for automated tools that can seamlessly bridge CDISC
    standards with modern clinical trial management platforms.
  solution: |-
    USDM OSB Uploader is a comprehensive Python-based automation tool that eliminates
    manual processes in clinical trial setup by providing seamless integration between
    USDM files and OSB platforms. The tool offers both complete study upload
    functionality and modular component management, allowing users to automate the
    entire study configuration process or handle specific elements individually.

    #### Key Features:
    * **Complete Study Upload**: Automated end-to-end upload of entire USDM studies with comprehensive validation
    * **Modular Architecture**: Independent modules for study components (arms, epochs, visits, criteria, activities)
    * **CLI Interface**: User-friendly command-line tools for both batch and individual operations
    * **Data Validation**: Pre-upload USDM compliance validation with Pydantic schema enforcement
    * **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and rollback support
    * **Type Safety**: Robust type-safe operations ensuring data integrity and API compatibility

    #### Technical Implementation:
    * Built with modern Python 3.13+ using asyncio for concurrent operations
    * HTTP client integration with comprehensive status code handling (400, 404, 409, 422, 500)
    * Pydantic-based data validation and settings management
    * Modular design allowing flexible workflow customization
  openSourceConsiderations: |-
    USDM OSB Uploader is published under GPL-3.0 license to promote transparency and
    community collaboration in clinical trial automation. The open-source approach
    enables the clinical research community to contribute improvements, report issues,
    and adapt the tool for various OSB implementations. This fosters innovation in
    clinical trial technology and ensures the tool remains accessible to organizations
    of all sizes, from academic research institutions to pharmaceutical companies.
    
    The open-source model also provides transparency in data handling processes,
    which is crucial for regulatory compliance and validation in clinical research
    environments.
  maintenanceModel: |-
    The project follows a standard GitHub-based development workflow with issues
    tracked through GitHub Issues. The development team actively maintains the
    codebase with regular updates and bug fixes. Community contributions are
    welcome through pull requests, and the project maintains clear contribution
    guidelines including code quality standards and testing requirements.
    
    The project uses modern Python packaging with uv for dependency management
    and includes pre-commit hooks for code quality assurance.
  projectSize: |-
    Using a T-shirt estimation, the project size is medium. The codebase includes
    comprehensive modules for all major OSB integration components, CLI interface,
    robust error handling, and extensive validation logic. The project represents
    several months of development effort focused on creating a production-ready
    automation tool for clinical trial management.
  contributors: |-
    Contributors should follow Python best practices and maintain code quality
    standards. The project uses pre-commit hooks for automated code formatting
    and linting. All contributions should include appropriate error handling,
    type hints, and maintain the modular architecture of the existing codebase.
  userDetails: |-
    Primary users include clinical programmers, study designers, and clinical data
    managers who work with USDM files and OSB platforms. Users are expected to
    have familiarity with CDISC standards, particularly USDM structure, and basic
    command-line interface usage. The tool is designed for technical users who
    understand clinical trial data structures and study design concepts.
  preRequisites: |-
    The software requires Python 3.13+ and is distributed as a Python package.
    Users need access to an OSB platform instance and valid USDM files for upload.
    The tool is platform-independent and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux
    systems. Installation is straightforward using uv package manager, and the
    tool can be used immediately after installation without additional configuration
    beyond OSB endpoint specification.
  projectServiceOptions: |-
    The tool is designed for self-service use by technical teams. Organizations
    can implement the tool directly in their clinical trial workflows. The modular
    architecture allows for customization and integration with existing systems.
    Support is provided through GitHub Issues and community collaboration.
  sponsors: N.A.
  goalsObjectives: |-
    The primary goal is to accelerate clinical trial initiation by automating
    manual study setup processes. The tool aims to reduce study setup time by
    90% while ensuring 100% CDISC compliance and eliminating data entry errors.
    Long-term objectives include expanding OSB platform support, adding more
    CDISC standard integrations, and building a community of contributors to
    enhance functionality and maintain the tool.
  communications: |-
    User interaction and support are organized through GitHub Issues for bug
    reports and feature requests. The project maintains clear documentation
    in the README file and welcomes community contributions through standard
    GitHub collaboration workflows. Updates and releases are communicated
    through GitHub releases and project documentation.
  additionalInformation: |-
    The tool represents a significant advancement in clinical trial automation,
    providing measurable benefits including 90% faster study setup, zero data
    entry errors through automated validation, and 100% CDISC compliance. The
    modular architecture supports flexible workflows while maintaining robust
    error handling and data integrity. This automation tool is part of the
    broader digital transformation in clinical research, helping accelerate
    the path from study design to patient enrollment.
